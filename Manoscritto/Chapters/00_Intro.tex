\chapter{Introduction}
Tensors are multidimensional arrays, that generalize matrices and vectors to higher dimension. More formally, an \N-way or \N th-order tensor is an element of the tensor product ot \N vector spaces.

Tensors are naturally suited to represent multdimensional problems: that's why they commonly arise in many applied contexts. From scientific computing to quantum mechanics, from signal analysis to computational chemistry, there is a strong and wide interest in having robust, fast and memory efficient methods for handling tensors.

In this work we will focus on the problem of representing a tensor, either exactly or through approximation, in a low-parametric format
provide a quick overview on two classic tensor decomposition
