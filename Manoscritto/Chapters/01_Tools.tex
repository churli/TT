\chapter{Preliminary definitions, notation and tools}

In this chapter we will go through the basic definitions and notation about tensors, introduce tensor unfoldings, see the most common tensor products and introduce the idea of tensor rank.

\section{Definitions and notation}

A \emph{tensor} is a multidimensional array. More formally, a \N-order tensor is an element of the tensor product of \N vector spaces. The idea of tensor generalizes those of \emph{matrix} and \emph{vector}, making possible to naturally represent data having a multi-way origin.

A \N-way tensor \ttensor{X} has elements $x_{i1,\ldots,iN}$

\begin{Def}
  The \emph{order}, or number of \emph{ways} or \emph{modes}, of a tensor is its number of dimensions, i.e. its number of indices.
\end{Def}

From this definition follows that vectors are tensors of order \emph{one}, matrices are tensors of order \emph{two}.
