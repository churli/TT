### Some notes on the Lab activity

1. Kolmogorov
   A big thanks to Kolmogorov, which represented a HUGE improvement in terms of performance in compressing and quality of life of who's writing.
   Setting up Kolmogorov for this task required installing a few pkgs via apt-get and a couple via pip. I tried to use virtualenv as much as possible in order to keep the main python install clean. E.g. I have installed ttpy on virtualenv via pip.
   See the specific notes on Kolmogorov itself for further info.

2. Bug(s) in ttpy
   Basically at about line 208 of maxvol in ttpy package the following line
       nd.core = reshape(q, (r1, n1, r2)).copy()
   had to be amended as
       nd.core = reshape(q, (r1, n1, -1)).copy()

   The file to be amended is here (@kolmogorov):
       /home/macchilocal/Tommaso/CompuLabTTGif/venv/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tt/cross/rectcross/rect_cross.py
